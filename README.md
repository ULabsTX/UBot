Power wheelchair robot

We had a Jazzy Select 6 powered wheelchair (mobility scooter?) donated to the makerspace, this project is for documenting our progress in deciphering the PG Drives Technology GC3 controller protocol between the joystick and motor controller.  This is because we don't want to buy another motor controller.
